we have 4 modules

app
presentation
domain
data

hilt is set up for project.

presentation layer-
MusicPlayerViewModel @Inject constructor(private val playMusicUseCase:PlayMusicUseCase)

domain layer-
class PlayMusicUseCase(private val repository:MusicRepository)
interface MusicRepository{
fun playMusic()
}

data layer-
class MusicRepositoryImpl():MusicRepository{
override fun playMusic(){
println("Playing")
}
}

we know that hilt will bind MusicRepository to MusicRepositoryImpl and provide it as dependency to UseCase

but it will do it in App module as app module is able to see both Domain and Data
but Domain can't see Data because Domain is the top most layer.
now challange is
if we remove Hilt and not use Injection, how we would provide MusicRepositoryImpl to Usecase?
with short saying- how we would make Domain to get Implementation?
